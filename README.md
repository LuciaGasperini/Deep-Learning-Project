# Deep-Learning-Project
This repository contains all the material that I've for the project of the Deep Learning course in the MSc in Artificial Intelligence UniBo (2022/2023). 

"Next Frame Prediction" consists of predicting the next frame in a short movie sequence.

For this project, we shall use the Moving MNIST dataset, composed of 10,000 video sequences, each consisting of 20 frames. In each video sequence, two digits move independently around the frame, which has a spatial resolution of 64Ã—64 pixels. The digits frequently intersect with each other and bounce off the edges of the frame.

While each sequence in the dataset is composed of 20 frames, your are supposed to use only 3 consecutive frames as input, and predict the next one.

The metric used to evaluate the quality of the predicted frame is Mean Squared Error.

As usual, functions for downloading the dataset and instructions for creating the dataset and testing the model are provided in the allegated notebook.
